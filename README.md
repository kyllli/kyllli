## üß© About Me

#### üéì Academic Background
I'm currently pursuing an M.S. in Applied Data Science at the University of Chicago, where I focus on applying machine learning to real-world business and geospatial problems.

Previously, I earned a B.S. in Mathematics and Statistics with highest distinction and honors from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa.

#### üíº Professional Experience
I currently work as a data scientist and project lead on a graduate-level capstone project sponsored by HERE Technologies through the University of Chicago. Our team focuses on improving lane model alignment algorithms using techniques such as point matching and graph matching to support high-definition map accuracy.

Previously, I worked at Cmind Inc as a data scientist, developing and optimizing machine learning models for earnings surprise prediction. I led efforts in accuracy tracking, created detailed performance reports, and produced visualizations such as prediction heatmaps ‚Äî one of which was featured in a [LinkedIn post by my former supervisor](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/weihongzhang_where-are-the-earnings-edges-hiding-this-activity-7327660344246476800-L2R2?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADe-xdABDJ3FKmHqfOc2RZyx10tHlRM_67M).

## üöÄ Featured Projects

#### üìç HERE Technologies ‚Äì Lane Model Alignment (*UChicago Capstone Project*)
Leading a graduate capstone project in collaboration with HERE Technologies to enhance lane model alignment using geospatial AI. Focus areas include spatial preprocessing, polyline densification, and iterative closest point (ICP) algorithms to support HD map generation.

#### üßò Fitness Center Customer Churn Analysis
Built a data pipeline for 25K+ customer records and developed classification models (logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, CatBoost). CatBoost achieved 92.6% accuracy, enabling insights that informed customer retention strategies.

#### üß† Toxic Comment Classification
Developed and fine-tuned deep learning models (Bi-LSTM, TextCNN, DistilBERT) using PyTorch, Keras, and TensorFlow. Achieved 95% accuracy in classifying toxic comments, improving content moderation systems.

#### üåê [Robustness of PageRank on Undirected Networks (*UNC Honor Thesis*)](https://doi.org/10.17615/93fj-kj91)
Conducted research under the supervision of [Prof. Mariana Olvera-Cravioto](https://molvera.web.unc.edu/), evaluating the robustness of PageRank on real-world networks. Simulated random graphs (Chung-Lu Model, Stochastic Block Model) to study effects of clustering coefficient, degree distribution, and community structure.
