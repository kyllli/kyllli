## 🧩 About Me

I'm a data scientist with 4+ years of experience in machine learning, predictive modeling, and statistical analysis.  
Currently, I'm pursuing an M.S. in Applied Data Science at the University of Chicago, where I work on geospatial AI problems with HERE Technologies.

Previously, I earned my B.S. in Mathematics and Statistics with honors from UNC Chapel Hill.  
I enjoy building robust models, optimizing ML pipelines, and applying AI to solve real-world problems—from customer retention to mapping systems.

## 🚀 My Projects

### 📍 HERE Technologies – Lane Model Alignment (Capstone Project)
Refining vehicle perception data alignment with lane models using spatial preprocessing, densification, and ICP algorithms to support HD map generation.

### 🧘 Fitness Center Customer Churn Analysis
Engineered a pipeline for 25K+ records and developed models including CatBoost (92.6% accuracy) to predict customer churn and optimize retention strategies.

### 🧠 Toxic Comment Classification
Built and fine-tuned deep learning models (Bi-LSTM, TextCNN, DistilBERT) using PyTorch, Keras & TensorFlow. Achieved 95% accuracy on toxic comment detection.

### 🌐 Robustness of PageRank on Undirected Networks
Analyzed network structures from SNAP, applied random graph models (Chung-Lu, SBM), and evaluated how network properties affect PageRank stability.
